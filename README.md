#TODO App

This project is built as basis to support:

 - **Docker**: as system administration, to manage various services in any project that I may build later
 - **API Server**: How Basic Server should be coded, with auth and stuff. Also to learn GraphQL while building this Server
 - **SPA**: Using React and Webpack vanilla setup, to support latest react all the time, build a frontend app that looks
  and feels good, but also easy to manage.
